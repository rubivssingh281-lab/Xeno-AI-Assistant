---

## 🚀 Installation

### Step 1 — Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rubivssingh281-lab/Xena-AI-Assistant.git
cd Xena-AI-Assistant
```

Or, if you have the file directly:

```bash
mkdir xena-assistant
cd xena-assistant
# Place xena.py inside this folder
```

---

### Step 2 — Create a Virtual Environment

It is strongly recommended to use a virtual environment to avoid dependency conflicts.

**Windows:**
```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

**macOS / Linux:**
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

---

### Step 3 — Install Python Packages

Install all dependencies in one go using the command below, or individually using the table above.

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip

pip install SpeechRecognition sounddevice pyttsx3 requests psutil pyautogui \
            screen-brightness-control Pillow opencv-python deepface numpy tf-keras
```

**Install TensorFlow (choose one):**

```bash
# CPU only (works on all machines)
pip install tensorflow

# GPU support (requires CUDA + cuDNN — for faster DeepFace inference)
pip install tensorflow-gpu
```

**Optional developer tools:**

```bash
# Jupyter Lab (for notebook launch feature)
pip install jupyterlab
```

**Verify your installation:**
```bash
python -c "import cv2, deepface, speech_recognition, pyttsx3, pyautogui, psutil; print('All core packages OK')"
```

---

### Step 4 — Install Ollama & Pull the LLM Model

Xena uses **Ollama** to run a local Mistral 7B LLM for open-ended questions and conversation.

**1. Download and install Ollama:**

- **Windows / macOS:** Download the installer from https://ollama.com/download
- **Linux:**
  ```bash
  curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh
  ```

**2. Start the Ollama server:**
```bash
ollama serve
```

> Ollama will listen on `http://localhost:11434` by default. Leave this terminal open while Xena is running, or configure Ollama to start as a system service.

**3. Pull the Mistral model (one-time download, ~4.5 GB):**
```bash
ollama pull mistral:7b-instruct-q5_K_M
```

**4. Verify the model is available:**
```bash
ollama list
# Should show: mistral:7b-instruct-q5_K_M
```

---

### Step 5 — Platform-Specific Notes

#### 🪟 Windows

- `pyttsx3` uses the built-in SAPI5 voices. At least one voice (David / Zira) is available by default.
- If Zira (female voice, index 1) is not found, Xena will fall back to the first available voice.
- Brightness control requires the monitor to support WMI. On some setups it may return an error — this is non-fatal.
- PyAutoGUI may need **`pywin32`** on some Windows versions:
  ```bash
  pip install pywin32
  ```

#### 🍎 macOS

- Install the `portaudio` dependency for `sounddevice`:
  ```bash
  brew install portaudio
  pip install sounddevice
  ```
- Grant microphone and camera permissions to Terminal (or your IDE) in **System Settings → Privacy & Security**.
- Grant accessibility permissions for `pyautogui` hotkeys: **System Settings → Privacy & Security → Accessibility**.
- `pyttsx3` uses the built-in `say` engine; macOS voices (e.g., Samantha) will be used.

#### 🐧 Linux (Ubuntu / Debian)

**Tkinter:**
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3-tk
```

**Audio (sounddevice + pyttsx3 eSpeak):**
```bash
sudo apt install portaudio19-dev espeak espeak-data libespeak-dev ffmpeg
pip install sounddevice pyttsx3
```

**Screen brightness:**
```bash
# ddcutil or xrandr must be installed for brightness control on Linux
sudo apt install ddcutil
# or
sudo apt install x11-xserver-utils
```

**Camera permissions:**
```bash
sudo usermod -a -G video $USER
# Log out and back in for the change to take effect
```

---

## ▶️ Running Xena

**1. Make sure Ollama is running** (in a separate terminal):
```bash
ollama serve
```

**2. Activate your virtual environment** (if not already active):
```bash
# Windows
venv\Scripts\activate

# macOS / Linux
source venv/bin/activate
```

**3. Launch Xena:**
```bash
python xena.py
```

The Xena GUI will open. Click **"🎤 Start Listening"** to activate voice recognition, or type directly into the **"Ask Xena"** text bar at the bottom of the window.

## 🤖 LLM Chat — Ask Xena

At the bottom of the right panel, there is a text input bar for chatting with the local Mistral LLM:

1. Make sure **Ollama is running** (`ollama serve` in a terminal).
2. Type any question into the **"Ask Xena"** text box.
3. Press **Enter** or click **"Ask Xena"**.
4. Xena will stream the response **token by token** into the conversation log, and then speak the full response aloud when complete.

Unrecognised voice commands are also automatically routed to the LLM.

**Example questions:**
- `"Explain how neural networks work in simple terms"`
- `"Write a Python function to reverse a string"`
- `"What is the capital of Australia?"`
- `"Give me a recipe for pasta carbonara"`

---

## 😊 Face & Emotion Recognition

### Starting Live Camera
1. Click **"📷 Start Camera"** in the webcam panel (bottom-right).
2. The live feed will appear in the panel below.

### Analyzing Emotions
1. Click **"🔍 Analyze Face"** (or say `"analyze face"`).
2. Xena records a **2-second burst** of frames and averages the emotion scores.
3. Results are logged and spoken aloud: e.g., *"Over 2 seconds, you appear happy. Top emotions: happy: 72%, neutral: 18%, surprised: 10%."*

### Live Detection Overlay
- Say `"toggle face recognition"` or call the function to draw **green rectangles** around detected faces in the live feed using OpenCV's Haar cascade.

---

## 🧑 Known Faces Setup

To enable **identity recognition**, add reference photos for people Xena should recognise:

**Method 1 — Manually:**
```
known_faces/
├── Alice/
│   ├── alice_photo1.jpg
│   └── alice_photo2.jpg
└── Bob/
    └── bob_photo.jpg
```

Place one or more clear face photos inside a folder named after the person, inside the `known_faces/` directory. DeepFace will index these automatically on first use.

**Method 2 — Programmatically:**
```python
app.add_known_face("Alice", "/path/to/alice.jpg")
```

This copies the image into `known_faces/Alice/` automatically.

> **Tip:** Use well-lit, front-facing photos for best recognition accuracy. Multiple photos per person improve matching.

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### "No TTS voices found" or Xena is silent
- **Windows:** Open **Settings → Time & Language → Speech** and verify at least one voice is installed (David or Zira).
- **macOS:** Open **System Settings → Accessibility → Spoken Content** and check voice availability.
- **Linux:** Run `sudo apt install espeak espeak-data` and restart.

### "Microphone unavailable – voice input disabled"
- Check that your microphone is connected and set as the default input device.
- On Linux: `sudo apt install portaudio19-dev` then `pip install sounddevice`.
- On macOS: Grant microphone permission to Terminal in **System Settings → Privacy → Microphone**.

### "Google speech recognition error"
- Xena uses Google's free Speech Recognition API which requires an internet connection.
- Check your network connection and try again.

### Ollama / LLM not responding
- Make sure you have started Ollama with `ollama serve` **before** launching Xena.
- Verify the model is present: `ollama list`
- If the model is missing: `ollama pull mistral:7b-instruct-q5_K_M`
- Check Ollama is accessible: `curl http://localhost:11434/api/tags`

### Webcam not opening
- Ensure no other application (e.g., Zoom, Teams) is using the camera.
- On Linux: make sure your user is in the `video` group: `sudo usermod -a -G video $USER`
- Try changing the camera index in the code: `cv2.VideoCapture(1)` instead of `0`.

### DeepFace / TensorFlow errors on first run
- DeepFace downloads its model weights (~200 MB) on first use. Ensure you have an internet connection for the first `analyze face` call.
- If you see a TensorFlow/Keras version conflict, install the compatibility shim: `pip install tf-keras`

### Brightness control not working
- **Windows:** WMI brightness control only works on laptop screens; external monitors are typically unsupported.
- **Linux:** Try installing `ddcutil` for external monitor support: `sudo apt install ddcutil`

### pyautogui hotkeys not working on macOS
- Go to **System Settings → Privacy & Security → Accessibility** and add your terminal or Python launcher to the allowed apps list.
